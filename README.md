# JDCraw
## Introduction
When investigating the use of RAW processing with Java, I found there weren't many useful tools available.
DCRaw is the standard way of processing RAW images, but there was no Java library available.

JDCraw is therefore a wrapper for the DCRaw executable. It has been based on the .NET version, [NDCRaw](https://github.com/AerisG222/NDCRaw).
